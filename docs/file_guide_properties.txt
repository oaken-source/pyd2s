                           Updated February 17, 2020

This document was created based on the excellent guides on the Phrozen Keep
forums regarding the columns in the Diablo II Data files.

Introduction

This file depends on ItemStatCost.txt.  A stat must be defined there in order
to use its ID in the stat1-7 fields.

The bulk of the file consists of seven function blocks. Each block has a
function index (FuncX) and three parameters (SetX, ValX, StatX). Parameters are
only useful if the underlying function is written to interpret them.

A '*' in the field name means it is a comment field not loaded into the game.

Column Descriptions

code: Property identifier to use in other txt files anywhere a property is
applied (e.g. MagicPrefix, MagicSuffix, Automagic, MonProp, Gems, Runes, Sets,
SetItems, UniqueItems, Cubemain).

*done: 1 if the property is active (boolean).

set1 to set7: Parameter to the property function, if the function can use it
(see Color property)

val1 to val7: Parameter to the property function, if the function can use it
(see class skills properties).

func1 to func7: Function used to assign a value to a property (see list below)

stat1 to stat7: Stat applied by the property (see ItemStatCost.txt), if the
function uses it.

*desc: Description of the property

*param: Description of the param value

*min: Description of the min value

*max: Description of the max value

*notes: Additional comments

*eol: Terminator field, not used in game, primary purpose is to keep Microsoft
Excel from misbehaving.
